# flutter_light_show_creator

A few days ago, I drove the Model X to experience a dancing light show. After looking at the Tesla light-show project, I found it a little difficult to get started, so I want to take some time to learn the relevant concepts and create an easy-to-use light show editor, hoping to automatically generate well-performing light show material files through simple music import. Then provides some simple and intuitive editing functions.
